This is the quickstart of official django rest framework documentation.

1. install venv, django, djangorestframework
2. create a project named tutorial
3. create an app named quickstart, within tutorial. (add it to project, (doc did not explicitly say this, but i did it anyway))
4. migrate the database.

note: tried to run migrations, error: no module named quickstart.
attempting to remove quickstart from installed_apps and try migrations again.
worked for now.

5. add a superuser admin-admin@example.com-1
6. add a serializers.py module to quickstart app
7. add views to quickstart app
8. add routers and urls to main app urls.py
9. add pagination to settings.py
10. add 'rest_framework' to installed_apps
